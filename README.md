# Dev-Folder

This repository contains code I wrote when learning new things, brainstorming, or going through some thought processes.

### Note

This repository contains many technologies and is not to be taken seriously.I work mainly with Rust (ðŸ’–), Python for quick development, and SvelteKit if needed. I like C# as well but I'm not currently focused on it, as I don't want to be distracted. Reach out to me via [email](mailto:midewest@gmail.com?subject=West%20Conversation) if you have any questions or need assistance.
